Expand the categories: Consider sub-classifications within categories (e.g., types of plastic or grades of paper) to further refine waste sorting and make the system more versatile.
Add environmental impact insights: Integrate a feature that provides users with information on the environmental benefits of properly classifying waste (e.g., estimated CO2 savings).

The use of CNNs and pretrained models like ResNet50 or EfficientNet is a robust choice. Fine-tuning on your dataset ensures better performance. To make the methodology more impactful:

    *Add explainability features like Grad-CAM to show which parts of the image influenced the classification decision, building trust in the system.
General Suggestions to Enhance Uniqueness:
*Enable the system to provide users with tips on proper disposal methods after classification.
*Explore integration with local recycling programs or apps, creating a seamless system for users to locate nearby recycling centers.
*Add a sustainability dashboard for tracking user contributions, like how much waste theyâ€™ve diverted from landfills or recycled over time.

Overall, well structured idea proposal :)
